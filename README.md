## Minimum requirements
Create CRUD using pure react and given API. Any other added functionality is up to you.

* List of all recipes
* Create of new recipe
* Recipe edit

Additional features:
* Use [Atomic Design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) for app structure
* Use [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)
* Separate UI and Business Logic
* Use components as much as possible (don't nest your UI elements in multiple DIVs, its kinda messy)
* Clear your `console.log()`
* Clear unused imports
* Don't use `var`
* Use arrow functions
* Create axios instance with default URL

For routing use [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/quick-start).
